## Understanding the problem

Students with certain disabilities tend to 
lose interest and leave studies unwillingly as 
they face a lot of challenges in their path of 
learning.  

Specially when it comes to giving exams the 
students are unable to find scribe/reader with 
proper qualifications at required location who 
can help them in examination
